        Iron Man is a superhero from Marvel Comics, first appearing in Tales of Suspense
         #39 in 1963. His alter ego, Tony Stark, is a billionaire genius, inventor, 
         and industrialist who built his first Iron Man suit after being captured and gravely injured. 
         The armor, powered by an Arc Reactor embedded in his chest, gives him superhuman strength, 
         flight, and a vast array of advanced weapons. Over time, Stark evolves from a self-centered
          businessman into a hero fighting for justice and peace. With his witty personality, 
          high-tech gadgets, and brilliant intellect, Iron Man becomes a founding member of the Avengers.
